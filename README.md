# Tuber

This is the developer documentation for the Tuber application, which allows users to save their favorite YouTube videos with additional useful information. The developer used the Atom text-editing platform, along with git and other software to write and test the code. The developer wrote the client facing code using HTML, SCSS (CSS), React and JavaScript (the API was written using Express.js).

### What is Tuber
**Noun: Avid YouTube user** | *NOT a potato*
Tuber was developed with the avid *tuber* as the first priority. A *tuber* can use this application to save information about his/her favorite YouTube videos, all in one easy-to-access and easily manipulated website.

*Tubers* can custom save the artist's name, title, album, a description and the URL for their favorite video. Any correctly entered "YouTube format" URL allows that video to played directly on the application, and incorrectly entered URLs lead to a pleasant surprise.

### Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to develop this application:
1. HTML5.
2. SCSS.
3. Bootstrap.
4. JavaScript.
5. Express.js
6. Node.js
7. MongoDB
8. Mongoose
9. Atom.
10. Git.
11. Github.
12. Heroku.
13. npm.
14. Curl.
15. AJAX.

### Development Process and Problem-Solving
Development for this application started by building an initial project scope, which was modified as necessary during development:
1. Developed application idea, and determined diagrammed ERDs for successful creation.
2. Scaffolded database tables for API.
3. Developed wireframes for desired user interface.
4. Made considerations for how various in-app screens would be displayed.
5. Placed heavy emphasis on meeting minimum viable product first. Initially applied minimal SCSS to ensure that the user experience met requirements, and additional styling was added near completion as time permitted.
6. Placed heavy emphasis on performing new tasks in new branches and making regular commits. Branch names explain what changes were made on that branch, and often include just one commit.

### Set up and installation instructions for application

Users who wish to download and improve upon this application may fork and clone from the public Github client repository [here](https://github.com/carlojacob/tuber) and the public API repository [here](https://github.com/carlojacob/tuber-api).

After forking and cloning the client repository, continue personalizing your set up by following the **Installation** steps provided [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/react-auth-template), beginning at `6. Replace the "homepage" field in package.json with your (public) Github account name and repository name.`.

After forking and cloning the API repository, continue personalizing your set up by following the **Installation** steps provided [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/express-api-template#installation), beginning at `7. Install dependencies with npm install.`.

Alternatively, you may choose to initialize your own repository by starting at step `1.` of either list of **Installation** steps.
